## pre-2012

- Was introduced to [Scratch] by my computer teacher at school.
  - [@ProgrammingFreak312]
  - Also had a lot of fun with Scratch derivatives like [BYOB/Snap!][Snap] and
    [Panther], these gave me an even more solid introduction into computer
science and programming.
- Was gifted huge books on DirectX and C++ programming, which I barely
  understood at the time, but I really enjoyed the shareware CD full of games!
